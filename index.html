    <ol type="1">
        <li>Strikeout: batter accumulates 3 strikes (misses the ball)</li>
        <li>Flyout: ball gets hit by batter and gets caught by a fielder</li>
        <li>Groundout: ball gets fielded by fielder and is thrown to first base before batter can reach</li>
        <li>Force out: Runner at first, but batter doesn't get a good hit. So, runner at first is forced to run, but batter gets out</li>
        <li>Double Play: two runners are out when the ielder throws the ball to both bases before the runners can reach</li>
    </ol>
