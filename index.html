<h3> Comparing Baseball and Cricket</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-family:'Courier New'">In Cricket, players run back and forth on a rectangular pitch to count runs. 
    However, in Baseball, players run through bases arranged at the corners in a rhombus shape.</li>
<li><strong>Some ways to get out in Baseball</strong>
    <ol style="font-family:'Courier New'" type="1">
        <li>Strikeout: Batter accumulates 3 strikes (misses the ball)</li>
        <li>Flyout: Ball gets hit by batter and gets caught by a fielder</li>
        <li>Groundout: Ball gets fielded by fielder and is thrown to first base before batter can reach</li>
        <li>Force out: Runner at first, but batter doesn't get a good hit. So, runner at first is forced to run, but batter gets out</li>
        <li>Double Play: Two runners are out when the fielder throws the ball to both bases before the runners can reach</li>
    </ol>
